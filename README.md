Rboxlo is a **free, open-source** Roblox private server where users can relive memories and create new ones. Using Rboxlo, you can set-up your own Roblox private server in minutes with support for Roblox clients dating all the way back to 2007 and as modern as 2017. Our aim is to let your creativity and imagination run wild on a platform where there is nobody to govern or dictate what you say or do.

## Features

**Fully open-source and decentralized**

There is no official "Rboxlo hub" or any network where Rboxlo instances connect to and meet up. Rboxlo is fully open-source, and what you do on your instance remains private on your instance. Rboxlo is also 100% open-source, with the entire platforms source code being hosted here. The entirety of Rboxlo's source code is released into the public domain, making it so that nobody can claim individual copyright over any part of Rboxlo.

**Multiple client version support**

Rboxlo supports Roblox clients as old as 2007 to Roblox clients as modern as 2017. So long as you have the Roblox game executables, Rboxlo implements all API endpoints to ensure 100% stability.

**Easy to set-up**

Setting up Rboxlo is a process that takes only a matter of minutes. You do not need to be a proficient sysadmin to figure out how to get the ball rolling.

**Modern-day codebase, secure**

Rboxlo does not use archaic technology, and is built using modern-day containerization, making so that if an attacker were to find a vulnerability in Rboxlo, the attack does not affect the hosts computer. Rboxlo also tries to use only the best security practices wherever possible.

**Customizability**

Make Rboxlo yours by customizing every single aspect of the platform. Whether it be the sites theme, the logos, the artwork, or even the color of the login button, everything is customizable.

**Cross-platform**

Rboxlo officially supports Linux and Windows out of the box at the server and client level. Though Roblox does not support Linux itself, Rboxlo attempts to use WINE to launch the Roblox game.

## Deployment

**Tech stack:**

- **Node.js** powers the server and everything surrounding it (REST API, matchmaker, etc.)
- **PostgreSQL** powers the server's database where all permanent data is stored
- **Docker** containerizes the server and runs it all in a secure fashion
- **.NET** is used in the client applications for smooth execution and cross-platform support

**Requirements:**

- **Docker** 20.10.0+
- **Visual Studio** 2019+

The requirements are very short and sweet because Docker is used to run the entire server, and Visual Studio is used to build the client applications.
